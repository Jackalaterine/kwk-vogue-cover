## Instructions

Write your code `index.html` and `style.css` to try to replicate the cover as closely as possible. Look up absolute positioning, and layering using `z-index` in order to layer items on top of each other!

You'll find the image of the model in `face.png` in the main folder.

## Advanced

That was an easy one. Pick the cover of the magazine of your choice, and use HTML and CSS to replicate it. Good luck!
